To Do:
1. GarfieldPhysics.cc : set xc,yc,zc (initial position of cluster) to be variables, will be input from Monte Carlo. Undertand these, xc, yc, zc

2. GarfieldRunAction.cc : Stop changing files. Open only one.

3. GarfieldEventAction.cc : Use global variable that increments for Event_ instead of ID.

4. 
Goal:
1. we want GEANT4 to take on ionization, then pass the output to HEED(Garfield) for drifting

5. Get rid of wire (HEED)

6. Give electron start and end positions
