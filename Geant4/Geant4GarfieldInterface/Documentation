### ATTENTION: To compile and link this program, a version of Geant4.10 has to be installed

To run the program in batch mode, please type >./exampleGarfield -m ./run.mac.
In run.mac one can set the material of the absorber that is used, and the type and energy of the particle that are fired with the particle gun.
The ionization model (PAIPhot or PAI model in Geant4, Heed in Garfield++) and the valid paticle types and energy ranges  can be set in the file physics.mac.
The program can also be run with visualization, for that type >./exampleGarfield, and then press the "run" button.

### run.mac
- Set absorber material
